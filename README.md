### Misc.
- Everything should be in python3
- Please use 4 spaces instead of tabs for indentation (PyCharm should be doing that by default).
- Try to keep track of any packages that you installed (just keep track of stuff you installed with pip in a text file, this will make it easier later when packaging into docker).
